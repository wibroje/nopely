The project's name and description

-nopely: the app that fetches less than desireable movies

Your wireframes and user stories

-coming soon

The technologies, APIs, and modules you used and a description of each

-This is a MEN stack app
-I used TMDB API to fetch movie data
-

A code snippet of a part of the app you're particularly proud of

-I think my genre fetching algorithms (app.js at line 84) are cool. I needed to find bad movies without being able to query genre and popularity simultaneously, so I added 1 to an interpolated random number variable on the end of my page query so that the page number would be somewhere in the hundreds (where all the bads are)

Any things you plan to fix or features you plan to add

-Yes. The User/Auth interface is quite lacking
-I also want to embed movies into users, and comments into movies so that users can have unique lists and write reviews
